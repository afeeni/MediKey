# MediKey!

Introducing MediKey, the digital health identity platform that securely transmits patient data from wearable devices, allowing doctors to remotely monitor their patients and make more informed treatment decisions. Our platform solves the problem of unconnected, inefficient, and unsecure remote monitoring of patients with chronic conditions or patients in an emergency situation, by providing real-time updates to doctors and enabling effective, expedient, and secure communication of pertinent medical information. MediKey uses Zero Knowledge Proof (”ZK Proof”) technology to ensure data security and patient privacy, which works seamlessly between healthcare networks and jurisdictions. With MediKey, patients can receive quality medical care based on pertinent medical records in their file. Join us in revolutionizing healthcare with effective, secure, and expedient medical communication.


### Scroll
We’re usking Scroll to process these transactions off chain, increasing patient information security, lowering costs, and in the future being able to verify patient information is correct, along with confirming identity especially when using IoT devices. We deploy using scroll due to their ease of use with EVM.



### Magic Wallet
Magic Wallet was very useful to be able to have users sign on even without directly connecting their wallet at first. Magic Wallet can also provide social media logins, which are common in applications today.

### Polygon 
This layer 2 solution is a great way to deploy our application due it's ability to integrate with many other products, including Chainlink Functions and Magic Wallet.

### MetaMask
MetaMask provides easy, secure login. MetaMask has browser extensions for easy login and have also been a very popular wallet option, opening easy login to a wide range of potential users.


## Roadmap

### Chainlink Functions
We hope to use Chainlink Functions in the future to integrate with web2 applications such as IoT devices. An example of this would include using Apple's HealthKit app along with Apple Watches to automatically push data such as heart rate, sleep, mobility, etc.

### Cypher
Cypher can be used to push notification to providers when there's something wrong with a patients vitals or records. Patients can also use this feautre to be notified when their health information is accessed. This created improved healthcare record security.
